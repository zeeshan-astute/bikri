	<li style="text-align:justify">adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">accurate and where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, is erased or rectified without delay;</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject;</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures;</li>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>How we use information</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The main reason we use your information is to provide and improve our services. We also use your information to protect you and to provide you with advertisements that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Security measures</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical access to the data, as well as access to, input, disclosure, ensuring availability and segregation of the data. We also have procedures in place to ensure the exercise of data subjects&#39; rights, deletion of data and response to data compromise. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account in the development and selection of hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as the provider, this online offer uses TLS encryption (Transport Layer Security), or better known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), which is now obsolete. You can recognise the secure, encrypted connection to this online offer by the identifier https:// of the entry in the URL line (address line) of the browser used and/or the green lock symbol. HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Cooperation with processors, joint controllers and third parties</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If, in the course of our processing, we disclose data to other persons and companies (order processors, jointly responsible persons or third parties), transfer it to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this will only be done on the basis of legal permission (e.g. if a transfer of the data to third parties, such as to payment service providers, is necessary for the performance of the contract), users have consented, a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If we disclose or transfer data to other companies in our group of companies or otherwise grant them access, this is done in particular for administrative purposes as a legitimate interest and, in addition, on a basis that complies with the legal requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Transfers to third countries</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside Nepal) or do so in the context of using third-party services or disclosing or transferring data to other persons or companies, this will only be done if it is done to fulfil our (pre-)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, due to a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we will only process or allow data to be processed in a third country if the legal requirements are met. This means, for example, that the processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a level of data protection or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Deletion of data</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The data processed by us will be deleted or restricted in its processing in accordance with the legal requirements. Unless expressly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted. I.e., the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Commercial and business services</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g., customers and interested parties in the context of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as related measures and in the context of communication with contractual partners (or pre-contractual), e.g., to answer enquiries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process this data to fulfil our contractual obligations, to secure our rights and for the purposes of the administrative tasks associated with this information as well as for business organisation. We only disclose the data of the contractual partners to third parties within the scope of the applicable law to the extent that this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or for the fulfilment of legal obligations or with the consent of the contractual partners (e.g., to participating telecommunications, transport, and other auxiliary services as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisers, payment service providers or tax authorities).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Unless otherwise specified the purposes of processing are Contractual performance and service, contact requests and communication, office and organisational procedures, administration, and response to requests, visit action evaluation, interest-based and behavioural marketing. And, the Legal bases are Contractual performance and pre-contractual inquiries, Legal obligation, and our Legitimate interests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Technical services</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process the data of our customers and Customers in order to enable them to select, purchase or commission the selected services or works. The required information is identified as such in the context of the order, purchase order or comparable contract conclusion and includes the information required for the provision of services and billing as well as contact information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Unless otherwise specified the purposes of processing are Contractual performance and service, contact requests and communication, office and organisational procedures, administration, and response to requests, visit action evaluation, interest-based and behavioural marketing. And, the Legal bases are Contractual performance and pre-contractual inquiries, Legal obligation, and our Legitimate interests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Administration, financial accounting, office organisation, contact management</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process data in the context of administrative tasks as well as organisation of our operations, financial accounting and compliance with legal obligations, such as archiving. In this regard, we process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The purpose and our interest in the processing lies in the administration, financial accounting, office organisation, archiving of data, i.e., tasks that serve the maintenance of our business activities, performance of our tasks and provision of our services. The deletion of data with regard to contractual services and contractual communication corresponds to the data mentioned in these processing activities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">In this context, we disclose or transfer data to consultants, such as legal advisors or auditors, as well as other fee offices and payment service providers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Furthermore, based on our business interests, e.g., for the purpose of contacting them at a later date. This data, most of which is company-related, is generally stored permanently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Data transfer to payment service providers</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">In order to fulfil the contract, we pass on your data to the company commissioned with the payment, insofar as this is necessary for the payment of our services. Depending on which payment method you select, we pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service provider. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves. In this case, the privacy policy of the respective payment service provider applies. The legal basis for the data processing is contract.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The data processed by the payment services include the payment data mentioned above. The information is necessary to carry out the transactions. However, the customer data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that data of the payment service provider is transmitted to credit agencies. In this regard, we refer to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the respective payment service providers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If there is an obligation to transmit your payment data to us (e.g., account number in the case of direct debit authorisation) after the conclusion of a fee-based contract, this data is required for payment processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Payment transactions via the common means of payment are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Data processing for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Where applicable, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data necessary for the processing of the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes (e.g., invoicing, processing of contested payments, accounting support). This serves to protect our legitimate interests in our protection against fraud or in efficient payment management, which outweigh our interests in the context of a balancing of interests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Legal defence and enforcement of our rights</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is our legitimate interest. The purpose of processing your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is the defence against unjustified claims and the legal enforcement and assertion of claims and rights.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Your personal data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. The processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement is mandatory for legal defence and enforcement of our rights. Consequently, there is no possibility for you to object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Use of customer data for direct marketing purposes</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="background-color:white">If you have provided us with your e-mail address when using our Services, we reserve the right to regularly send you e-mail offers for similar services. We do not need to obtain your separate consent for this. In this respect, the data processing is carried out solely on the basis of our legitimate interest in personalised direct advertising. If you have initially objected to the use of your e-mail address for this purpose, we will not send you any e-mails. </span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="background-color:white">You are entitled to object to the use of your e-mail address for the aforementioned advertising purpose at any time with effect for the future by notifying the responsible person named at the beginning. After receipt of your objection, the use of your e-mail address for advertising purposes will cease immediately. If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the marketing.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Provision of our contractual and business services</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process the data of our user, supporters, interested parties, customers or other persons, insofar as we offer them contractual services or act within the scope of existing business relationships, e.g., towards user, or are ourselves recipients of services and benefits. Furthermore, we process the data of data subjects on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g., when it concerns administrative tasks or public relations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The data processed in this context, the type, scope and purpose and the necessity of their processing are determined by the underlying contractual relationship. In principle, this includes inventory and master data of the persons (e.g., name, address, etc.), as well as contact data (e.g., e-mail address, telephone, etc.), contract data (e.g., services used, contents and information provided, names of contact persons) and, if we offer services subject to payment, payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We delete data that is no longer required to fulfil our statutory and business purposes. This is determined according to the respective tasks and contractual relationships. In the case of business processing, we retain the data for as long as it may be relevant for the processing of the business as well as with regard to any warranty or liability obligations. The necessity of retaining the data is reviewed every three years; otherwise, the statutory retention obligations apply.</p>

When creating a profile, you can submit personal data such as your profile picture, business information, photos, a short and biography. Profile content and data are publicly viewable. You have choices about the information on your profile. You don&rsquo;t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services. It&rsquo;s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be available. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of the service. We store the data until you delete your user account. Insofar as legal retention periods are to be observed, storage also takes place beyond the time of deletion of a user account.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Use of our platform</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If you wish to use the platform, you must register. The provision of the aforementioned data is mandatory. Subsequently, the <a name="_Hlk97478971">service user </a>can define his password and complete the registration. For these purposes, we use the e-mail address that is or will be stored in the customer master data for the purpose of the business relationship.</p>

The users can manage and change all information in the platform. If you use our platform, we store the data required for the fulfilment of the contract until final deletion of the access and/or after expiry of the statutory retention periods. For a longer period, the data could also be processed on the basis of our legitimate interest (legal defence, debt collection, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">To prevent unauthorised access to your personal data by third parties, the connection is encrypted using TLS technology. When using the platform, we also collect data listed above. When using the platform, no cookies are stored on your computers. Only an encrypted token is stored in the browser, which essentially contains the name of the user and his or her rights. This data point is stored in the browser&#39;s internal memory and deleted there as soon as the user logs out. You can delete the token by setting your browser software accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Security measures</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical access to the data, as well as access to, input, disclosure, ensuring availability and segregation of the data. We also have procedures in place to ensure the exercise of data subjects&#39; rights, deletion of data and response to data compromise. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account in the development and selection of hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of data protection through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as the provider, this online offer uses TLS encryption (Transport Layer Security), or better known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), which is now obsolete. You can recognise the secure, encrypted connection to this online offer by the identifier https:// of the entry in the URL line (address line) of the browser used and/or the green lock symbol. HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Cooperation with processors, joint controllers and third parties</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If, in the course of our processing, we disclose data to other persons and companies (order processors, jointly responsible persons or third parties), transfer it to them or otherwise grant them access to the data, this will only be done on the basis of legal permission (e.g. if a transfer of the data to third parties, such as to payment service providers, is necessary for the performance of the contract), users have consented, a legal obligation provides for this or on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. when using agents, web hosts, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If we disclose or transfer data to other companies in our group of companies or otherwise grant them access, this is done in particular for administrative purposes as a legitimate interest and, in addition, on a basis that complies with the legal requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Transfers to third countries</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside Nepal) or do so in the context of using third-party services or disclosing or transferring data to other persons or companies, this will only be done if it is done to fulfil our (pre-)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, due to a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we will only process or allow data to be processed in a third country if the legal requirements are met. This means, for example, that the processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a level of data protection or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Deletion of data</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The data processed by us will be deleted or restricted in its processing in accordance with the legal requirements. Unless expressly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If the data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted. I.e., the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g., customers and interested parties in the context of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as related measures and in the context of communication with contractual partners (or pre-contractual), e.g., to answer enquiries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process this data to fulfil our contractual obligations, to secure our rights and for the purposes of the administrative tasks associated with this information as well as for business organisation. We only disclose the data of the contractual partners to third parties within the scope of the applicable law to the extent that this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or for the fulfilment of legal obligations or with the consent of the contractual partners (e.g., to participating telecommunications, transport, and other auxiliary services as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisers, payment service providers or tax authorities).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Unless otherwise specified the purposes of processing are Contractual performance and service, contact requests and communication, office and organisational procedures, administration, and response to requests, visit action evaluation, interest-based and behavioural marketing. And, the Legal bases are Contractual performance and pre-contractual inquiries, Legal obligation, and our Legitimate interests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Technical services</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process the data of our customers and Customers in order to enable them to select, purchase or commission the selected services or works. The required information is identified as such in the context of the order, purchase order or comparable contract conclusion and includes the information required for the provision of services and billing as well as contact information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Unless otherwise specified the purposes of processing are Contractual performance and service, contact requests and communication, office and organisational procedures, administration, and response to requests, visit action evaluation, interest-based and behavioural marketing. And, the Legal bases are Contractual performance and pre-contractual inquiries, Legal obligation, and our Legitimate interests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Administration, financial accounting, office organisation, contact management</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process data in the context of administrative tasks as well as organisation of our operations, financial accounting and compliance with legal obligations, such as archiving. In this regard, we process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The purpose and our interest in the processing lies in the administration, financial accounting, office organisation, archiving of data, i.e., tasks that serve the maintenance of our business activities, performance of our tasks and provision of our services. The deletion of data with regard to contractual services and contractual communication corresponds to the data mentioned in these processing activities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">In this context, we disclose or transfer data to consultants, such as legal advisors or auditors, as well as other fee offices and payment service providers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Furthermore, based on our business interests, e.g., for the purpose of contacting them at a later date. This data, most of which is company-related, is generally stored permanently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Data transfer to payment service providers</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">In order to fulfil the contract, we pass on your data to the company commissioned with the payment, insofar as this is necessary for the payment of our services. Depending on which payment method you select, we pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service provider. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves. In this case, the privacy policy of the respective payment service provider applies. The legal basis for the data processing is contract.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The data processed by the payment services include the payment data mentioned above. The information is necessary to carry out the transactions. However, the customer data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that data of the payment service provider is transmitted to credit agencies. In this regard, we refer to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the respective payment service providers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If there is an obligation to transmit your payment data to us (e.g., account number in the case of direct debit authorisation) after the conclusion of a fee-based contract, this data is required for payment processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Payment transactions via the common means of payment are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Data processing for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Where applicable, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data necessary for the processing of the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes (e.g., invoicing, processing of contested payments, accounting support). This serves to protect our legitimate interests in our protection against fraud or in efficient payment management, which outweigh our interests in the context of a balancing of interests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Legal defence and enforcement of our rights</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is our legitimate interest. The purpose of processing your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is the defence against unjustified claims and the legal enforcement and assertion of claims and rights.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">Your personal data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. The processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement is mandatory for legal defence and enforcement of our rights. Consequently, there is no possibility for you to object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Use of customer data for direct marketing purposes</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="background-color:white">If you have provided us with your e-mail address when using our Services, we reserve the right to regularly send you e-mail offers for similar services. We do not need to obtain your separate consent for this. In this respect, the data processing is carried out solely on the basis of our legitimate interest in personalised direct advertising.

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="background-color:white">You are entitled to object to the use of your e-mail address for the aforementioned advertising purpose at any time with effect for the future by notifying the responsible person named at the beginning.

If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the marketing.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Provision of our contractual and business services</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We process the data of our user, supporters, interested parties, customers or other persons, insofar as we offer them contractual services or act within the scope of existing business relationships, e.g., towards user, or are ourselves recipients of services and benefits. Furthermore, we process the data of data subjects on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g., when it concerns administrative tasks or public relations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">The data processed in this context, the type, scope and purpose and the necessity of their processing are determined by the underlying contractual relationship. In principle, this includes inventory and master data of the persons (e.g., name, address, etc.), as well as contact data (e.g., e-mail address, telephone, etc.), contract data (e.g., services used, contents and information provided, names of contact persons) and, if we offer services subject to payment, payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">We delete data that is no longer required to fulfil our statutory and business purposes. This is determined according to the respective tasks and contractual relationships. In the case of business processing, we retain the data for as long as it may be relevant for the processing of the business as well as with regard to any warranty or liability obligations. The necessity of retaining the data is reviewed every three years; otherwise, the statutory retention obligations apply.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"><strong>Creating an account</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Personal data will continue to be collected and processed if you provide it to us for the performance of a contract or when opening an account. Which data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. Deletion of your account is possible at any time and can be done by sending a message to us. We store and use the data provided by you for the purpose of processing the contract. After complete processing of the contract or deletion of your customer account, your data will be blocked with regard to tax and commercial law retention periods and deleted after expiry of these periods, unless you have expressly consented to a further use of your data or a legally permitted further use of data has been reserved on our part.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm"><strong>Convenience log in and sign up</strong></p>

When creating a profile, you can submit personal data such as your profile picture, business information, photos, a short and biography. Profile content and data are publicly viewable. You have choices about the information on your profile. You don&rsquo;t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services. It&rsquo;s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be available. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of the service. We store the data until you delete your user account. Insofar as legal retention periods are to be observed, storage also takes place beyond the time of deletion of a user account.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify"><strong>Use of our platform</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify">If you wish to use the platform, you must register. The provision of the aforementioned data is mandatory.

When using the platform, we also collect data listed above. When using the platform, no cookies are stored on your computers. Only an encrypted token is stored in the browser, which essentially contains the name of the user and his or her rights. This data point is stored in the browser&#39;s internal memory and deleted there as soon as the user logs out. You can delete the token by setting your browser software accordingly.</p>

Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we will only process or allow data to be processed in a third country if the legal requirements are met. This means, for example, that the processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a level of data protection or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Deletion of data</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed by us will be deleted or restricted in its processing in accordance with the legal requirements.

In this regard, we process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The purpose and our interest in the processing lies in the administration, financial accounting, office organisation, archiving of data, i.e., tasks that serve the maintenance of our business activities, performance of our tasks and provision of our services. The deletion of data with regard to contractual services and contractual communication corresponds to the data mentioned in these processing activities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">In this context, we disclose or transfer data to consultants, such as legal advisors or auditors, as well as other fee offices and payment service providers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Furthermore, based on our business interests, e.g., for the purpose of contacting them at a later date.

Depending on which payment method you select, we pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service provider. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves. In this case, the privacy policy of the respective payment service provider applies. The legal basis for the data processing is contract.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed by the payment services include the payment data mentioned above. The information is necessary to carry out the transactions. However, the customer data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that data of the payment service provider is transmitted to credit agencies. In this regard, we refer to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the respective payment service providers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If there is an obligation to transmit your payment data to us (e.g., account number in the case of direct debit authorisation) after the conclusion of a fee-based contract, this data is required for payment processing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Payment transactions via the common means of payment are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Data processing for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Where applicable, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data necessary for the processing of the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes (e.g., invoicing, processing of contested payments, accounting support). This serves to protect our legitimate interests in our protection against fraud or in efficient payment management, which outweigh our interests in the context of a balancing of interests.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Legal defence and enforcement of our rights</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is our legitimate interest. The purpose of processing your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is the defence against unjustified claims and the legal enforcement and assertion of claims and rights.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Your personal data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. The processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement is mandatory for legal defence and enforcement of our rights. Consequently, there is no possibility for you to object.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Use of customer data for direct marketing purposes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:white\\\">If you have provided us with your e-mail address when using our Services, we reserve the right to regularly send you e-mail offers for similar services. We do not need to obtain your separate consent for this. In this respect, the data processing is carried out solely on the basis of our legitimate interest in personalised direct advertising. If you have initially objected to the use of your e-mail address for this purpose, we will not send you any e-mails. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:white\\\">You are entitled to object to the use of your e-mail address for the aforementioned advertising purpose at any time with effect for the future by notifying the responsible person named at the beginning. After receipt of your objection, the use of your e-mail address for advertising purposes will cease immediately. If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the marketing.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Provision of our contractual and business services</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We process the data of our user, supporters, interested parties, customers or other persons, insofar as we offer them contractual services or act within the scope of existing business relationships, e.g., towards user, or are ourselves recipients of services and benefits. Furthermore, we process the data of data subjects on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g., when it concerns administrative tasks or public relations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed in this context, the type, scope and purpose and the necessity of their processing are determined by the underlying contractual relationship. In principle, this includes inventory and master data of the persons (e.g., name, address, etc.), as well as contact data (e.g., e-mail address, telephone, etc.), contract data (e.g., services used, contents and information provided, names of contact persons) and, if we offer services subject to payment, payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history, etc.).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We delete data that is no longer required to fulfil our statutory and business purposes.

Which data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. Deletion of your account is possible at any time and can be done by sending a message to us. We store and use the data provided by you for the purpose of processing the contract. After complete processing of the contract or deletion of your customer account, your data will be blocked with regard to tax and commercial law retention periods and deleted after expiry of these periods, unless you have expressly consented to a further use of your data or a legally permitted further use of data has been reserved on our part.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\"><strong>Convenience log in and sign up</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\">Third-party Connect features such as Facebook Connect, and Google are offered as an option to register with us.

If you make use of the option, the relevant profile data you provide will be transferred to your profile. Of course, you can change the information at any time via the settings in your profile. When creating a profile, you can submit personal data such as your profile picture, business information, photos, a short and biography. Profile content and data are publicly viewable. You have choices about the information on your profile. You don&rsquo;t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services. It&rsquo;s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be available. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of the service. We store the data until you delete your user account. Insofar as legal retention periods are to be observed, storage also takes place beyond the time of deletion of a user account.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Use of our platform</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If you wish to use the platform, you must register. The provision of the aforementioned data is mandatory. Subsequently, the <a name=\\\"_Hlk97478971\\\">service user </a>can define his password and complete the registration. For these purposes, we use the e-mail address that is or will be stored in the customer master data for the purpose of the business relationship.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We process personal data of users for the purpose of using the Sajilo Kharid Bikri platform and for the purpose of fulfilling the contract. The users can manage and change all information in the platform. If you use our platform, we store the data required for the fulfilment of the contract until final deletion of the access and/or after expiry of the statutory retention periods. For a longer period, the data could also be processed on the basis of our legitimate interest (legal defence, debt collection, etc.).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">To prevent unauthorised access to your personal data by third parties, the connection is encrypted using TLS technology. When using the platform, we also collect data listed above. When using the platform, no cookies are stored on your computers. Only an encrypted token is stored in the browser, which essentially contains the name of the user and his or her rights. This data point is stored in the browser&#39;s internal memory and deleted there as soon as the user logs out. You can delete the token by setting your browser software accordingly.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Contacting others</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Of course, we also process your chats and communications with other user as well as the content you publish, as necessary for the operation of the services.

You share information with other user when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you&rsquo;re comfortable being visible. If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Updating your information</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If you believe that the information, we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, or object to its processing, please do so within your user account or contact us. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user.

A push service is used to provide you with useful tips and information directly on your mobile device or similar devices. When we send a push message, we send the message with the corresponding IDs or tokens to the Push Notification Service. This then ensures that the push message is sent to the devices that wish to receive such a notification. Our legitimate interest is to be able to present current information to you directly. The personal data will only be processed as long as this is necessary for the provision of the function. You have the right to object. You can prevent your data from being processed further by deactivating the push service in the respective system settings of the operating system of your device.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Firebase </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We use the Firebase service in our app, a service provided by Google LLC (&quot;Google&quot;), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA and Google Ireland Limited (&quot;Google&quot;), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The Firebase is a web hosting and backend service provided by Google LLC or by Google Ireland Limited, depending on the location from which this application is accessed.

Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we will only process or allow data to be processed in a third country if the legal requirements are met.

In this regard, we process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The purpose and our interest in the processing lies in the administration, financial accounting, office organisation, archiving of data, i.e., tasks that serve the maintenance of our business activities, performance of our tasks and provision of our services. The deletion of data with regard to contractual services and contractual communication corresponds to the data mentioned in these processing activities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">In this context, we disclose or transfer data to consultants, such as legal advisors or auditors, as well as other fee offices and payment service providers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Furthermore, based on our business interests, e.g., for the purpose of contacting them at a later date.

Depending on which payment method you select, we pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service provider. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves. In this case, the privacy policy of the respective payment service provider applies. The legal basis for the data processing is contract.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed by the payment services include the payment data mentioned above. The information is necessary to carry out the transactions. However, the customer data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them.

In this regard, we refer to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the respective payment service providers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If there is an obligation to transmit your payment data to us (e.g., account number in the case of direct debit authorisation) after the conclusion of a fee-based contract, this data is required for payment processing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Payment transactions via the common means of payment are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Data processing for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Where applicable, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data necessary for the processing of the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes (e.g., invoicing, processing of contested payments, accounting support). This serves to protect our legitimate interests in our protection against fraud or in efficient payment management, which outweigh our interests in the context of a balancing of interests.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Legal defence and enforcement of our rights</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is our legitimate interest.

If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the marketing.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Provision of our contractual and business services</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We process the data of our user, supporters, interested parties, customers or other persons, insofar as we offer them contractual services or act within the scope of existing business relationships, e.g., towards user, or are ourselves recipients of services and benefits. Furthermore, we process the data of data subjects on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g., when it concerns administrative tasks or public relations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed in this context, the type, scope and purpose and the necessity of their processing are determined by the underlying contractual relationship. In principle, this includes inventory and master data of the persons (e.g., name, address, etc.), as well as contact data (e.g., e-mail address, telephone, etc.), contract data (e.g., services used, contents and information provided, names of contact persons) and, if we offer services subject to payment, payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history, etc.).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We delete data that is no longer required to fulfil our statutory and business purposes.

When creating a profile, you can submit personal data such as your profile picture, business information, photos, a short and biography. Profile content and data are publicly viewable. You have choices about the information on your profile. You don&rsquo;t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services. It&rsquo;s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be available. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of the service. We store the data until you delete your user account.

The users can manage and change all information in the platform. If you use our platform, we store the data required for the fulfilment of the contract until final deletion of the access and/or after expiry of the statutory retention periods.

When using the platform, we also collect data listed above. When using the platform, no cookies are stored on your computers. Only an encrypted token is stored in the browser, which essentially contains the name of the user and his or her rights. This data point is stored in the browser&#39;s internal memory and deleted there as soon as the user logs out. You can delete the token by setting your browser software accordingly.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Contacting others</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Of course, we also process your chats and communications with other user as well as the content you publish, as necessary for the operation of the services.

You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Data processing for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Where applicable, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data necessary for the processing of the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes (e.g., invoicing, processing of contested payments, accounting support). This serves to protect our legitimate interests in our protection against fraud or in efficient payment management, which outweigh our interests in the context of a balancing of interests.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Legal defence and enforcement of our rights</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is our legitimate interest. The purpose of processing your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is the defence against unjustified claims and the legal enforcement and assertion of claims and rights.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Your personal data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. The processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement is mandatory for legal defence and enforcement of our rights. Consequently, there is no possibility for you to object.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Use of customer data for direct marketing purposes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:white\\\">If you have provided us with your e-mail address when using our Services, we reserve the right to regularly send you e-mail offers for similar services. We do not need to obtain your separate consent for this. In this respect, the data processing is carried out solely on the basis of our legitimate interest in personalised direct advertising.

After receipt of your objection, the use of your e-mail address for advertising purposes will cease immediately. If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the marketing.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Provision of our contractual and business services</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We process the data of our user, supporters, interested parties, customers or other persons, insofar as we offer them contractual services or act within the scope of existing business relationships, e.g., towards user, or are ourselves recipients of services and benefits. Furthermore, we process the data of data subjects on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g., when it concerns administrative tasks or public relations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed in this context, the type, scope and purpose and the necessity of their processing are determined by the underlying contractual relationship. In principle, this includes inventory and master data of the persons (e.g., name, address, etc.), as well as contact data (e.g., e-mail address, telephone, etc.), contract data (e.g., services used, contents and information provided, names of contact persons) and, if we offer services subject to payment, payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history, etc.).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We delete data that is no longer required to fulfil our statutory and business purposes. This is determined according to the respective tasks and contractual relationships. In the case of business processing, we retain the data for as long as it may be relevant for the processing of the business as well as with regard to any warranty or liability obligations. The necessity of retaining the data is reviewed every three years; otherwise, the statutory retention obligations apply.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\"><strong>Data processing in relation to our website and app</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Log files</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">In principle, it is possible to use the Sajilo Kharid Bikri website without providing personal data. When a page of our website is accessed and each time a file is retrieved, access data about this process is stored in a log file. The corresponding log file contains: Your IP address, the page from which the file was requested, the name of the file, the date and time of the request, the amount of data transferred, the access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.), a description of the type of operating system and web browser used. The stored data does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your identity and is evaluated exclusively for statistical purposes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The collection and processing of this data is carried out in order to enable the use of the website at all, on the basis of our legitimate interest, whereby our legitimate interest is the provision of our website. Incidentally, we store this aforementioned data, including the IP addresses, only in anonymised form and use it only in this anonymised form to analyse the use of the offer and the further development and optimisation of our website in your interest. Our legitimate interest is the ongoing improvement of our online offer in order to provide you with the greatest possible user comfort.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>General app accesses</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">As with every server request, information such as IP address, user agent etc. is transmitted and stored anonymously in the server log for 30 days. The provision of personal data is neither legally nor contractually required, nor is it necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide the personal data. However, failure to provide the data could result in you not being able to use our app or not being able to use it to its full extent. The legal basis for this data processing is consent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\"><strong>Network access</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\">The legal basis for this data processing is contract. Your data will be treated confidentially by us and deleted if you revoke the rights to use it or it is no longer required to provide the services and there is no legal obligation to retain it. The provision of personal data is necessary if you wish to make full use of our app. However, failure to provide this data could result in you not being able to use our app or not being able to use it to its full extent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Contacting Us</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If you contact us and send us general enquiries the contact details you provide, will be stored and used by us to fulfil the purpose associated with the transmission, e.g., to process your enquiry or in the event of follow-up questions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The basis for this storage and use of your personal data is your consent which you give us by sending the contact form. Insofar as you provide us with your personal data for the purpose of responding to your questions, the entry of personal data is required as without this information, we cannot process your request.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">You have the right to revoke your consent to the data processing described above at any time with effect for the future. In this case, we will no longer process your data. Your personal data will be deleted even without your revocation in any case if we have processed your request or if the storage is inadmissible for other legal reasons.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">During the use of our website, so-called &quot;cookies&quot;, small text files, are stored on your computer. Such cookies register information about your computer&#39;s navigation on our website (pages selected, day, time and duration of use, etc.). A cookie is downloaded via a browser the first time you visit a website. The next time you visit this website with the same device, the browser checks whether a corresponding cookie is present (i.e., contains the website name). It sends the data stored in the cookie back to the website. Some cookies are important for the website&#39;s functionality and are automatically activated by us when a user visits.

The use of the cookies we use is necessary in order to be able to provide the online offer of Sajilo Kharid Bikri at all and, moreover, to be able to optimise it on an ongoing basis. The data processing in this context is therefore based on our legitimate interest. Our legitimate interest is to provide visitors to our website with a functioning online service and to make visiting and using the website as pleasant and efficient as possible.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">For further information on cookies in general, please visit <a href=\\\"http://www.allaboutcookies.org\\\" style=\\\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\\\">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and for further details on the cookies we use, please refer to our Cookie Policy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\"><strong>Creating an account</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\">Personal data will continue to be collected and processed if you provide it to us for the performance of a contract or when opening an account. Which data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. Deletion of your account is possible at any time and can be done by sending a message to us. We store and use the data provided by you for the purpose of processing the contract. After complete processing of the contract or deletion of your customer account, your data will be blocked with regard to tax and commercial law retention periods and deleted after expiry of these periods, unless you have expressly consented to a further use of your data or a legally permitted further use of data has been reserved on our part.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\"><strong>Convenience log in and sign up</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\">Third-party Connect features such as Facebook Connect, and Google are offered as an option to register with us. When registering via connect functions of third-party providers, you agree to the respective terms and conditions of these third-party providers and also consent to certain data from your respective profile of being transferred to us.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Profile</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">As a registered user, you have the opportunity to create a user profile with just a few clicks and details. If you make use of the option, the relevant profile data you provide will be transferred to your profile. Of course, you can change the information at any time via the settings in your profile. When creating a profile, you can submit personal data such as your profile picture, business information, photos, a short and biography. Profile content and data are publicly viewable. You have choices about the information on your profile. You don&rsquo;t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services. It&rsquo;s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be available. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of the service. We store the data until you delete your user account. Insofar as legal retention periods are to be observed, storage also takes place beyond the time of deletion of a user account.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Use of our platform</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If you wish to use the platform, you must register. The provision of the aforementioned data is mandatory. Subsequently, the <a name=\\\"_Hlk97478971\\\">service user </a>can define his password and complete the registration. For these purposes, we use the e-mail address that is or will be stored in the customer master data for the purpose of the business relationship.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We process personal data of users for the purpose of using the Sajilo Kharid Bikri platform and for the purpose of fulfilling the contract. The users can manage and change all information in the platform. If you use our platform, we store the data required for the fulfilment of the contract until final deletion of the access and/or after expiry of the statutory retention periods. For a longer period, the data could also be processed on the basis of our legitimate interest (legal defence, debt collection, etc.).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">To prevent unauthorised access to your personal data by third parties, the connection is encrypted using TLS technology. When using the platform, we also collect data listed above. When using the platform, no cookies are stored on your computers. Only an encrypted token is stored in the browser, which essentially contains the name of the user and his or her rights. This data point is stored in the browser&#39;s internal memory and deleted there as soon as the user logs out. You can delete the token by setting your browser software accordingly.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Contacting others</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Of course, we also process your chats and communications with other user as well as the content you publish, as necessary for the operation of the services. In addition to the information, you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others. User may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We also share some user&rsquo; information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services. You share information with other user when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you&rsquo;re comfortable being visible. If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Updating your information</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If you believe that the information, we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, or object to its processing, please do so within your user account or contact us. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Installation of our app</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Our app can be downloaded from the app stores &quot;Google Playstore&quot; and &quot;Apple App Store&quot;.

A push service is used to provide you with useful tips and information directly on your mobile device or similar devices. When we send a push message, we send the message with the corresponding IDs or tokens to the Push Notification Service. This then ensures that the push message is sent to the devices that wish to receive such a notification. Our legitimate interest is to be able to present current information to you directly.

Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we will only process or allow data to be processed in a third country if the legal requirements are met. This means, for example, that the processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination of a level of data protection or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Deletion of data</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed by us will be deleted or restricted in its processing in accordance with the legal requirements.

In this regard, we process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The purpose and our interest in the processing lies in the administration, financial accounting, office organisation, archiving of data, i.e., tasks that serve the maintenance of our business activities, performance of our tasks and provision of our services. The deletion of data with regard to contractual services and contractual communication corresponds to the data mentioned in these processing activities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">In this context, we disclose or transfer data to consultants, such as legal advisors or auditors, as well as other fee offices and payment service providers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Furthermore, based on our business interests, e.g., for the purpose of contacting them at a later date.

Depending on which payment method you select, we pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service provider. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves. In this case, the privacy policy of the respective payment service provider applies. The legal basis for the data processing is contract.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed by the payment services include the payment data mentioned above. The information is necessary to carry out the transactions. However, the customer data entered is only processed by the payment service providers and stored by them. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that data of the payment service provider is transmitted to credit agencies. In this regard, we refer to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the respective payment service providers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If there is an obligation to transmit your payment data to us (e.g., account number in the case of direct debit authorisation) after the conclusion of a fee-based contract, this data is required for payment processing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Payment transactions via the common means of payment are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Data processing for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Where applicable, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data necessary for the processing of the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes (e.g., invoicing, processing of contested payments, accounting support). This serves to protect our legitimate interests in our protection against fraud or in efficient payment management, which outweigh our interests in the context of a balancing of interests.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Legal defence and enforcement of our rights</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is our legitimate interest. The purpose of processing your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is the defence against unjustified claims and the legal enforcement and assertion of claims and rights.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Your personal data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. The processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement is mandatory for legal defence and enforcement of our rights. Consequently, there is no possibility for you to object.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Use of customer data for direct marketing purposes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:white\\\">If you have provided us with your e-mail address when using our Services, we reserve the right to regularly send you e-mail offers for similar services. We do not need to obtain your separate consent for this. In this respect, the data processing is carried out solely on the basis of our legitimate interest in personalised direct advertising. If you have initially objected to the use of your e-mail address for this purpose, we will not send you any e-mails. </span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:white\\\">You are entitled to object to the use of your e-mail address for the aforementioned advertising purpose at any time with effect for the future by notifying the responsible person named at the beginning. After receipt of your objection, the use of your e-mail address for advertising purposes will cease immediately. If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the marketing.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Provision of our contractual and business services</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We process the data of our user, supporters, interested parties, customers or other persons, insofar as we offer them contractual services or act within the scope of existing business relationships, e.g., towards user, or are ourselves recipients of services and benefits. Furthermore, we process the data of data subjects on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g., when it concerns administrative tasks or public relations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed in this context, the type, scope and purpose and the necessity of their processing are determined by the underlying contractual relationship. In principle, this includes inventory and master data of the persons (e.g., name, address, etc.), as well as contact data (e.g., e-mail address, telephone, etc.), contract data (e.g., services used, contents and information provided, names of contact persons) and, if we offer services subject to payment, payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history, etc.).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We delete data that is no longer required to fulfil our statutory and business purposes.

When creating a profile, you can submit personal data such as your profile picture, business information, photos, a short and biography. Profile content and data are publicly viewable. You have choices about the information on your profile. You don&rsquo;t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services. It&rsquo;s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be available. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of the service. We store the data until you delete your user account.

The users can manage and change all information in the platform. If you use our platform, we store the data required for the fulfilment of the contract until final deletion of the access and/or after expiry of the statutory retention periods.

When using the platform, we also collect data listed above. When using the platform, no cookies are stored on your computers. Only an encrypted token is stored in the browser, which essentially contains the name of the user and his or her rights. This data point is stored in the browser&#39;s internal memory and deleted there as soon as the user logs out. You can delete the token by setting your browser software accordingly.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Contacting others</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Of course, we also process your chats and communications with other user as well as the content you publish, as necessary for the operation of the services.

You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Data processing for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Where applicable, we provide our service providers with further data, which they use together with the data necessary for the processing of the payment as our processors for the purpose of fraud prevention and optimisation of our payment processes (e.g., invoicing, processing of contested payments, accounting support). This serves to protect our legitimate interests in our protection against fraud or in efficient payment management, which outweigh our interests in the context of a balancing of interests.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Legal defence and enforcement of our rights</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is our legitimate interest. The purpose of processing your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement of our rights is the defence against unjustified claims and the legal enforcement and assertion of claims and rights.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Your personal data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. The processing of your personal data in the context of legal defence and enforcement is mandatory for legal defence and enforcement of our rights. Consequently, there is no possibility for you to object.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Use of customer data for direct marketing purposes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:white\\\">If you have provided us with your e-mail address when using our Services, we reserve the right to regularly send you e-mail offers for similar services. We do not need to obtain your separate consent for this. In this respect, the data processing is carried out solely on the basis of our legitimate interest in personalised direct advertising.

After receipt of your objection, the use of your e-mail address for advertising purposes will cease immediately. If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the marketing.</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Provision of our contractual and business services</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We process the data of our user, supporters, interested parties, customers or other persons, insofar as we offer them contractual services or act within the scope of existing business relationships, e.g., towards user, or are ourselves recipients of services and benefits. Furthermore, we process the data of data subjects on the basis of our legitimate interests, e.g., when it concerns administrative tasks or public relations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The data processed in this context, the type, scope and purpose and the necessity of their processing are determined by the underlying contractual relationship. In principle, this includes inventory and master data of the persons (e.g., name, address, etc.), as well as contact data (e.g., e-mail address, telephone, etc.), contract data (e.g., services used, contents and information provided, names of contact persons) and, if we offer services subject to payment, payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history, etc.).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We delete data that is no longer required to fulfil our statutory and business purposes. This is determined according to the respective tasks and contractual relationships. In the case of business processing, we retain the data for as long as it may be relevant for the processing of the business as well as with regard to any warranty or liability obligations. The necessity of retaining the data is reviewed every three years; otherwise, the statutory retention obligations apply.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\"><strong>Data processing in relation to our website and app</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Log files</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">In principle, it is possible to use the Sajilo Kharid Bikri website without providing personal data. When a page of our website is accessed and each time a file is retrieved, access data about this process is stored in a log file. The corresponding log file contains: Your IP address, the page from which the file was requested, the name of the file, the date and time of the request, the amount of data transferred, the access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.), a description of the type of operating system and web browser used. The stored data does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your identity and is evaluated exclusively for statistical purposes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The collection and processing of this data is carried out in order to enable the use of the website at all, on the basis of our legitimate interest, whereby our legitimate interest is the provision of our website. Incidentally, we store this aforementioned data, including the IP addresses, only in anonymised form and use it only in this anonymised form to analyse the use of the offer and the further development and optimisation of our website in your interest. Our legitimate interest is the ongoing improvement of our online offer in order to provide you with the greatest possible user comfort.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>General app accesses</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">As with every server request, information such as IP address, user agent etc. is transmitted and stored anonymously in the server log for 30 days. The provision of personal data is neither legally nor contractually required, nor is it necessary for the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide the personal data. However, failure to provide the data could result in you not being able to use our app or not being able to use it to its full extent. The legal basis for this data processing is consent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\"><strong>Network access</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\">The legal basis for this data processing is contract. Your data will be treated confidentially by us and deleted if you revoke the rights to use it or it is no longer required to provide the services and there is no legal obligation to retain it. The provision of personal data is necessary if you wish to make full use of our app. However, failure to provide this data could result in you not being able to use our app or not being able to use it to its full extent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Contacting Us</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If you contact us and send us general enquiries the contact details you provide, will be stored and used by us to fulfil the purpose associated with the transmission, e.g., to process your enquiry or in the event of follow-up questions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">The basis for this storage and use of your personal data is your consent which you give us by sending the contact form. Insofar as you provide us with your personal data for the purpose of responding to your questions, the entry of personal data is required as without this information, we cannot process your request.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">You have the right to revoke your consent to the data processing described above at any time with effect for the future. In this case, we will no longer process your data. Your personal data will be deleted even without your revocation in any case if we have processed your request or if the storage is inadmissible for other legal reasons.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">During the use of our website, so-called &quot;cookies&quot;, small text files, are stored on your computer. Such cookies register information about your computer&#39;s navigation on our website (pages selected, day, time and duration of use, etc.). A cookie is downloaded via a browser the first time you visit a website. The next time you visit this website with the same device, the browser checks whether a corresponding cookie is present (i.e., contains the website name). It sends the data stored in the cookie back to the website. Some cookies are important for the website&#39;s functionality and are automatically activated by us when a user visits.

The use of the cookies we use is necessary in order to be able to provide the online offer of Sajilo Kharid Bikri at all and, moreover, to be able to optimise it on an ongoing basis. The data processing in this context is therefore based on our legitimate interest. Our legitimate interest is to provide visitors to our website with a functioning online service and to make visiting and using the website as pleasant and efficient as possible.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">For further information on cookies in general, please visit <a href=\\\"http://www.allaboutcookies.org\\\" style=\\\"color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline\\\">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and for further details on the cookies we use, please refer to our Cookie Policy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\"><strong>Creating an account</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\">Personal data will continue to be collected and processed if you provide it to us for the performance of a contract or when opening an account. Which data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. Deletion of your account is possible at any time and can be done by sending a message to us. We store and use the data provided by you for the purpose of processing the contract. After complete processing of the contract or deletion of your customer account, your data will be blocked with regard to tax and commercial law retention periods and deleted after expiry of these periods, unless you have expressly consented to a further use of your data or a legally permitted further use of data has been reserved on our part.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\"><strong>Convenience log in and sign up</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\\\">Third-party Connect features such as Facebook Connect, and Google are offered as an option to register with us. When registering via connect functions of third-party providers, you agree to the respective terms and conditions of these third-party providers and also consent to certain data from your respective profile of being transferred to us.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Profile</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">As a registered user, you have the opportunity to create a user profile with just a few clicks and details. If you make use of the option, the relevant profile data you provide will be transferred to your profile. Of course, you can change the information at any time via the settings in your profile. When creating a profile, you can submit personal data such as your profile picture, business information, photos, a short and biography. Profile content and data are publicly viewable. You have choices about the information on your profile. You don&rsquo;t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services. It&rsquo;s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be available. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data is the establishment and implementation of the user contract for the use of the service. We store the data until you delete your user account. Insofar as legal retention periods are to be observed, storage also takes place beyond the time of deletion of a user account.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Use of our platform</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If you wish to use the platform, you must register. The provision of the aforementioned data is mandatory. Subsequently, the <a name=\\\"_Hlk97478971\\\">service user </a>can define his password and complete the registration. For these purposes, we use the e-mail address that is or will be stored in the customer master data for the purpose of the business relationship.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We process personal data of users for the purpose of using the Sajilo Kharid Bikri platform and for the purpose of fulfilling the contract. The users can manage and change all information in the platform. If you use our platform, we store the data required for the fulfilment of the contract until final deletion of the access and/or after expiry of the statutory retention periods. For a longer period, the data could also be processed on the basis of our legitimate interest (legal defence, debt collection, etc.).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">To prevent unauthorised access to your personal data by third parties, the connection is encrypted using TLS technology. When using the platform, we also collect data listed above. When using the platform, no cookies are stored on your computers. Only an encrypted token is stored in the browser, which essentially contains the name of the user and his or her rights. This data point is stored in the browser&#39;s internal memory and deleted there as soon as the user logs out. You can delete the token by setting your browser software accordingly.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Contacting others</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Of course, we also process your chats and communications with other user as well as the content you publish, as necessary for the operation of the services. In addition to the information, you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others. User may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">We also share some user&rsquo; information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services. You share information with other user when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you&rsquo;re comfortable being visible. If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Updating your information</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">If you believe that the information, we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, or object to its processing, please do so within your user account or contact us. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\"><strong>Installation of our app</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm; text-align:justify\\\">Our app can be downloaded from the app stores &quot;Google Playstore&quot; and &quot;Apple App Store&quot;.

A push service is used to provide you with useful tips and information directly on your mobile device or similar devices. When we send a push message, we send the message with the corresponding IDs or tokens to the Push Notification Service. This then ensures that the push message is sent to the devices that wish to receive such a notification. Our legitimate interest is to be able to present current information to you directly.
